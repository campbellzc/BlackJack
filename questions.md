##Questions

1. When the dealer gets 21 with his first 2 cards, it still adds a card when it should stay.
2. My code counts how many wins, losses, and draws the player has had over the course of playing.
3. It is easier to call classes that you know will work inside your other classes to make it less complicated and easier to troubleshoot.
4. A private variable or method can only be called inside its class. A public variable or method can be called anywhere.
5. An instance is just an object that other classes can call upon. For example, the player class can have a deck or a card.
6. Inheritance is when a class inherits a daughter class that the other methods or classes can call upon, and that you know will work.
7. "This" references the variable inside the class you are using. "Super" calls the constructor.
8. Behaviour and State.
9. Sometimes the classes are confusing and it is hard to keep track of all the different parts.
